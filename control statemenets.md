Until now, our intepreter can only do some arithmetic computation and it is not "turing complete". That means its no powerful enough to complete any tasks that other programming langagues can do.
In order to make it "turing complete", we need our intepreter to have jump and loop. Jump is actually conditional execution which is the if..else.. statement we have seen in many languages.
